  I'm a developer, primarily C#/.Net after years with Visual FoxPro and a bit
  of JavaScript coding.  I decided to add Java to my resume, so I'm going 
  to document a number of projects for others like me who want to go from 
  coding in Java to developing in Java.
  
  This is a remake of the  1970's Star Trek game which I designed from memory.
  Gene Hilpert and I spent many an hour working on code and playing games 
  in one of the many Dec terminal sites on the campus of UW Stevens Point, and
  this one was at the top of our list.  
  
  If you don't know what the original Star Trek game is like, there's lots of good
  references on the web, and I can only say that I'm sorry you missed so much fun 
  when people were actually inventing how this stuff should work.
  
  This is essentially a board game, so it's a turn based model advanced by user interaction.  
  A real-time action game would require a different approach.  Nothing happens until the 
  user takes a turn and then we update everything and wait for the user to take another turn.
  
  I hope to use this and a couple other projects as starting points, for blog articles about
  code and design, with evolution of them as I become more proficient at developing in Java.  
  Since there is no single "right way" to design things, I'll be interested in seeing what 
  you have to say and offer as ideas.
  
  I hope you enjoy looking through this and can get something out of it.  It was 
  a really fun project that gave me an opportunity to learn new things and helped 
  me flesh out some ideas and concepts.
